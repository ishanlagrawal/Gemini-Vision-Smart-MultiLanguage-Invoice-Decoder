ðŸš€ Unlocking the Power of Generative AI with Google Gemini and Streamlit! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to introduce our latest AI-powered web app that leverages Google Geminiâ€™s Vision AI for multilingual invoice decoding! ðŸ’«

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

Technologies Used: Streamlit for the frontend and Google Gemini's Vision Model for AI-driven content generation.
Image & Text Input: Users can upload invoice images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) and submit text prompts to get insightful responses.
Smart Content Generation: The model interprets both the image and text prompt, providing detailed answers about the invoice.
How it Works:

Users upload an invoice image and enter a question or prompt through an intuitive interface.
The app uses Google Gemini Vision API to process the inputs and generate context-aware responses.
Responses are displayed dynamically, creating an interactive user experience.
Why this Matters:

This project showcases how platforms like Streamlit can harness the capabilities of Generative AI models like Google Gemini to deliver smart, interactive solutions. Itâ€™s an exciting development in making AI more accessible and advancing image understanding and natural language processing!
